# 27" iMac 2017 to 5K Display Conversion

Here are my notes from the conversion process. I wanted to use one cable (USB-C) for everything (camera, speakers, microphone) except ethernet, because I already have a faster wireless connection. Ethernet on USB 2.0 could be 100Mbps maximum. If you want to use it, you can connect USB ethernet card to one of the USB 2.0 ports that are outside of the case. Files for 3D printer are included.

## What is included

- Camera 3840 x 2160 12MP
- Original speakers with custom Crossovers (audio polypropylene capacitor and air-cored inductor)
- Microphone is outside of the case for better sound quality, but still needs app with echo canceling for video calls
- Driver Board R1811 V4 (brain of the display)
- Stock Power Adapter reusing iMac power connector
- Current Board DZ-LP0818 (brightness board)
- Noctua fan in position of Apple logo in the back
- USB 2.0 hub (4 ports) for camera and 3x USB 2.0 ports outside of the case

## What you need

- Patience
- Basic soldering skills with soldering stuff
- Wires for connecting speakers and crossovers with driver board
